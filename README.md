# YunFetch

YunFetch is a simple system information fetching tool written in C#. I made this just for myself, but maybe I'll make it configurable and modular in the near future.
**Due to this being a project solely for myself, this might not work as expected for anyone else.**

## Features

- Displays detailed system information in the terminal.
- Supports customization of output colors based on the Catppuccin Latte color scheme.
- Includes CPU, GPU, RAM, storage, and monitor information.
- Written in C# for cross-platform compatibility.

## Prerequisites
- An arch-based distro
- .NET 8
- An nvidia GPU (AMD GPUs might get displayed weirdly due to my very basic stdout parsing)

## Usage
Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/bhenrich/yunfetch.git`
Do whatever you want.
